spend_tracker
=============

A Simple Spend Tracker with charts

I created this to track my spending - every time I spent money I recorded the transactions and captured a couple pieces of inforamtion about that transaction. 
I used a library called pChart to create charts of my spending habits:
- Daily
- Monthly
- Type of spending
- Category
- Amount
- Location
- And a few others

I used this instead of a service like Mint because I was able to capture custom attributes, and because I wanted to make sure it worked.
